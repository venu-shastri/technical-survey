# ðŸ“˜ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Project Overview

| Element         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Project Name** | FloorPlanViz |
| **Purpose**      | Visualize, validate, and export electronic floorplans with connectivity annotations. |
| **Stakeholders** | Architects, RTL designers, Layout Engineers, QA, Product Owner |
| **Scope**        | The tool reads DSL/XML floorplan descriptions, builds a hierarchical model, enables visualization, and validates design rules. |
| **Assumptions**  | Users work on Linux workstations with Python and Qt installed. |
| **Constraints**  | Performance must support 10k+ nodes per view; extensibility required for future integration with other EDA tools. |
