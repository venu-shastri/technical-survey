# 🛠️  Code Duplication & Code Reuse Survey(PBF)



**Objective:**  

This internal survey aims to identify reusable code across our repositories involved in PBF Codebase . Your feedback will help us reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and foster collaboration across teams.

- [ ] Yes  

- [ ] No

## 🧩 Section 5: Reusable Function/Module Template



> Fill out this section for **each function/module** you believe is a candidate for reuse. You can copy-paste this block multiple times if needed.



### 🔍 Function Reuse Candidate



**Function/Module Name:**  

[Short name of the function or module]



**Brief Description:**  

[What does this function do? What problem does it solve?]



**Location (File/Path/Repo):**  

[Where is it currently implemented?]



**How often have you seen or written similar logic?**  

- [ ] Frequently  

- [ ] Occasionally  

- [ ] Rarely  

- [ ] Not sure



**Why do you think it should be reused?**  

[Explain its generality, repetition, or usefulness across components]



**Dependencies (if any):**  

[List any third-party or project-specific dependencies it requires]



**Can it be decoupled easily from the current implementation?**  

- [ ] Yes  

- [ ] No  

- [ ] Needs Refactoring  

- [ ] Not sure

## ⚠️ Section 4: Pain Points and Suggestions



**6. What are the main reasons reuse does not happen currently?**  

- [ ] Lack of awareness of existing code  

- [ ] Tight deadlines / pressure to deliver  

- [ ] Code is not modular enough to reuse  

- [ ] Too much coupling in existing code  

- [ ] Poor documentation / hard to understand  

- [ ] Others: ____________



**7. Suggestions for improving code reuse (technical or process-related):**  

[Your answer]



**8. Would you be willing to contribute to identifying and curating reusable components?**  

- [ ] Yes  

- [ ] No  

- [ ] Maybe
