#### How do I write/document software requirements in a way that directly supports or drives E2E (End-to-End) testing?

> shifting from "feature listing" to behavior-centric, testable specifications.

✅ The Goal: Document Requirements That Are E2E-Testable
Instead of just saying “the tool should parse a DSL file,” you define:

💬 "Given a valid DSL file with 10,000 components, when the user loads it using the CLI, then a hierarchical model should be created and available for search and export."

This kind of requirement is:
- User-oriented
- End-to-end observable
- Testable from the outside
- Suitable for automation or manual E2E validation

## 🧩 Functional Requirements

### Requirement ID: FR-02
Title: Search Component by Name
Type: Functional
Priority: High

**Given**

A model is loaded using floorviz load -f sample.dsl

The component ALU_1 exists in the model

**When**
The user runs:
```sh
floorviz search -n ALU_1
```
**Then**
- CLI prints the full path or hierarchy location of ALU_1
- Returns exit code 0

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Output contains ALU_1
- Component path is valid and matches DSL
- Search is case-insensitive

### Requirement ID: FR-03
Title: Export Layout to SVG
Type: Functional
Priority: Medium

**Given**
A DSL file is loaded using floorviz load -f layout.dsl
**When**
The user runs:
```sh
floorviz export -t svg -o layout.svg
```
**Then**
- File layout.svg is created
- Contains an SVG representation of the layout
- SVG is well-formed and viewable in standard tools

**Acceptance Criteria**
- File exists and is non-empty
- Contains expected number of <rect> or <g> SVG elements
- No errors in stdout or stderr

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Requirement ID: NFR-01
Title: Render Performance
Type: Non-Functional
Priority: High

**Given**
A DSL file with 10,000 components is loaded
**When**
The layout is rendered or exported via floorviz render or floorviz export
**Then**
- Operation completes within 500ms

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Time-to-render/export measured using system timer is < 500ms
- CPU usage stays below 80% during operation

Memory usage does not exceed 200MB



 ### What You Get from E2E-Oriented Requirements
✅ Clear test scenarios

✅ Traceability to business value and behavior

✅ Fewer ambiguities for dev and QA teams

✅ Reusable language for UAT & automation
