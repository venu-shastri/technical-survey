#### How do I write/document software requirements in a way that directly supports or drives E2E (End-to-End) testing?

> shifting from "feature listing" to behavior-centric, testable specifications.

✅ The Goal: Document Requirements That Are E2E-Testable
Instead of just saying “the tool should parse a DSL file,” you define:

💬 "Given a valid DSL file with 10,000 components, when the user loads it using the CLI, then a hierarchical model should be created and available for search and export."

This kind of requirement is:
- User-oriented
- End-to-end observable
- Testable from the outside
- Suitable for automation or manual E2E validation

| “System shall export layout as SVG” | “When a layout is loaded, user can export it as SVG using the `export` command, and the generated file must contain the same number of components as the layout model.” |


🧩 E2E-Centric Requirement Structure (Recommended Format)
Use the Given–When–Then (Gherkin-style) structure for each requirement or scenario.

📘 Template for Documenting E2E-Oriented Requirements
## Requirement ID: FR-01

### Title: Load Floorplan from DSL File

**Given:**  
- A DSL file containing a valid floorplan with 100+ components  
- The CLI tool is installed and configured

**When:**  
- The user runs the command `floorviz load -f test.dsl`

**Then:**  
- The CLI should return status code 0 (success)  
- The system model should contain all top-level and nested components  
- The model should be accessible for subsequent commands (`search`, `export`)

 ### What You Get from E2E-Oriented Requirements
✅ Clear test scenarios

✅ Traceability to business value and behavior

✅ Fewer ambiguities for dev and QA teams

✅ Reusable language for UAT & automation
